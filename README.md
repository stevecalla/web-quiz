## Functional/Features Implemented

1. TBD
2. TBD
3. EventListner - added event listener inside function after element was created since that element didn't exist at initial loading of the page.
4. Add/remove hover CSS style on answers using single function & bracket notation to pass "add"/"remove" as a parameter appended to "element.classList["add" or "remove"]"
5. Validation: When on the save score page, if the user doesn't save the score but clicks the "View High Scores" link, a window confirm popup appears to confirm that they don't want to save it.

## Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
